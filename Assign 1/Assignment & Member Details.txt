2. A short description of what you did?

ANSWER:

We have done a Python code (juypter lab) and did Split Training Data for Cross-validation for both 'test' and 'train' files which were given
first we imported libraries on python then started coding by uploading test.csv and train.csv file then we scatter file by using matplotlib library
then initialize values in 'X' and 'Y' then checked its lenght, we also used 'from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression' library to cross validate
dataset properly and in the last just check our score.

3. List what insights you gained from this assignment?

ANSWER:

If we have huge amount of dataset we can split that data into some ratio i.e 80%, 20% or 70%, 10%, 10%
and can find an accurate result after shuffling these type of cross validation use in different companies or industries
which have some huge amount of datasets.

The python code you used to train, test and predict the digits?

CODE:

//import pandas as pd
//df = pd.read_csv("test.csv")
//df.head()
//import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
//%matplotlib inline
//plt.scatter(df['pixel0'],df['pixel783'])
//X = df[['pixel0']]
//Y = df['pixel783']	 
//Y
//from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
//X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X,Y,test_size =0.2)
//len (X_train)
//len (X_test)
//from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
//clf = LinearRegression()
//clf.fit(X_train,Y_train)	
//clf.predict(X_test)
//Y_test
//clf.score(X_train,Y_train)

4. Each member should commit his/her own work, Iâ€™ll be checking the contribution %

50% was my contribution (Jawad Lodhi 61845) as i have made GITHUB, KAGGLE accounts and made reposritries also did some code
on the other hand Saad Ali Siddiqui and Abdul Rahim completed the code and contributed 25% respectively.
